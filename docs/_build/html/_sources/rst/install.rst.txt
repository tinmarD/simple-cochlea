Installation
============

The simplecochlea package runs with Python 3.

If you have conda installed, you can create a new environment to avoid any troubles with your current setup.

You will need a C compiler to complete the installation, as simplecochlea uses Cython code to boost performances.
 * In Unix systems, the gcc compiler should be installed.
 * Windows users can download Microsoft Visual Studio which contain a compiler. See `WindowsCompilers <https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers>`_ to know which version is more suited to your Python version.
